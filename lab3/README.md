For Lab 3, we were assigned to manipulate data from 2 free APIs to display weather information on Troy, NY. From OpenWeather API I used the Current Weather data and 5 day / 3 hour forecast data. I used this data to display the current temperature and real feel as well as the 5 day forecast displaying the min and max temperatures. The second API I used was Open-Mateo, where I pulled air quality data from. I displayed the air quality index, PM2.5 level, PM10 level, nitrogen dioxide level, and ozone level. I wanted to display icons that corresponded with the weather, to do this I used the icon data from the API as well as an online Github repository. I used the corresponding icon name from the api with the images from the repository. I also used information from Accuweather to show the meanings of the various air quality metrics I displayed. I got a bit stuck at the beginning of this lab, since I have not worked with APIs before. However reading the API docs for both APIs really helped break down the information I would be pulling from each API.
